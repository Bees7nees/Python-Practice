'''
I will learn how to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings, using List Comprehension.
This allows me to create a new list without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.

In this project, I will write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

The project has two phases: first, I will use a for loop to implement the program.
Then, I will learn how to use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results.

Earlier versions of the code are left commented for reference.
