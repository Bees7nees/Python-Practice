'''
As per the freeCodeCamp.org course on Python:

I will be using numerical methods to approximate solutions to mathematical problems that
are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

In this project, I will explore the numerical method of bisection to find the square root
of a number by iteratively narrowing down the possible range of values that contain
the square root.
